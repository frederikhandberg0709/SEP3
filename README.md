# SEP3

This project was developed as part of our third semester project (SEP3) for our **Software Engineering** degree.

The goal of the semester project was to design and implement a distributed system consisting of at least two servers. Our team chose to build a system for a fictional real estate agency called **Real Estate Plus**.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `/Blazor`: A Blazor web application for customers.
- `/GUI`: A JavaFX desktop application designed for administrative users.
- `/restful-server`: A Java Spring Boot REST server that handles backend operations and API requests.
- `/signalr-server`: A SignalR server that delivers real-time notifications to the Blazor web application.

## Functional Requirements

The system was designed to meet the following functional requirements defined through user stories. Each user story represents a specific feature or capability written to reflect the user's goals and interactions with the system.

**Create user account:** As a customer, I want to have the ability to create an account, so that I can access extra features like save bookmarks and book an agent.

**Create administrator account:** As an administrator, I want to have the ability to create an account, so that I can manage properties, bookings, and agents.

**Update user information:** As a customer, I want to be able to update my user account details, so that the agency can still contact me if my information changes.

**Property filters:** As a customer, I want to have the ability to use filters such as, property type, so that I can find a property that matches my needs.

**Book agent:** As a customer, I want to be able to book an appointment with an agent, so that I can receive further information and ask questions about a specific property.

**Bookmark property listings:** As a customer, I want to be able to bookmark listings, so that I can easily revisit and review them later.

**Real-time notifications:** As a customer, I want to receive notifications about my bookmarked properties, so that I can stay updated on any changes to them.

**Search in admin dashboard:** As an administrator, I want to be able to search for property listings, so that I can quickly find the specific property Iâ€™m looking for.

**Create property listing:** As an administrator, I want to be able to create new property listings, so that they can be added to the website.

**Upload property images:** As an administrator, I want to be able to upload images of properties, so that customers can visually assess whether they are interested in a property.

**Update property details:** As an administrator, I want to be able to update the details of property listings, so that I can ensure all information remains accurate and up to date.

**Delete property listing:** As an administrator, I want to be able to delete property listings, so that outdated or irrelevant listings no longer appear to customers.
