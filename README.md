# SEP3

This project was developed as part of our third semester project (SEP3) for our **Software Engineering** degree.

The goal of the semester project was to design and implement a distributed system consisting of at least two servers. Our team chose to build a system for a fictional real estate agency called **Real Estate Plus**.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `/Blazor`: A Blazor web application for customers.
- `/GUI`: A JavaFX desktop application designed for administrative users.
- `/restful-server`: A Java Spring Boot REST server that handles backend operations and API requests.
- `/signalr-server`: A SignalR server that delivers real-time notifications to the Blazor web application.

## Tech Stack

- `Frontend (Web)`: Blazor
- `Frontend (Desktop)`: JavaFX
- `Backend (REST API)`: Java Spring Boot
- `Real-time notifications`: SignalR
- `Database`: PostgreSQL
