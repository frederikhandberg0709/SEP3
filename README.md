# SEP3

This project was developed as part of our third semester project (SEP3) for our **Software Engineering** degree.

The goal of the semester project was to design and implement a distributed system consisting of at least two servers. Our team chose to build a system for a fictional real estate agency called **Real Estate Plus**.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `/Blazor`: A Blazor web application for customers.
- `/GUI`: A JavaFX desktop application designed for administrative users.
- `/restful-server`: A Java Spring Boot REST server that handles backend operations and API requests.
- `/signalr-server`: A SignalR server that delivers real-time notifications to the Blazor web application.

## Functional Requirements

The system was designed to meet the following functional requirements defined through user stories. Each user story represents a specific feature or capability written to reflect the user's goals and interactions with the system.

**Create user account:** As a customer, I want to have the ability to create an account, so that I can access extra features like save bookmarks and book an agent.

**Create administrator account:** As an administrator, I want to have the ability to create an account, so that I can manage properties, bookings, and agents.

**Update user information:** As a customer, I want to be able to update my user account details, so that the agency can still contact me if my information changes.

**Property filters:** As a customer, I want to have the ability to use filters such as, property type, so that I can find a property that matches my needs.

**Book agent:** As a customer, I want to be able to book an appointment with an agent, so that I can receive further information and ask questions about a specific property.

**Bookmark property listings:** As a customer, I want to be able to bookmark listings, so that I can easily revisit and review them later.

**Real-time notifications:** As a customer, I want to receive notifications about my bookmarked properties, so that I can stay updated on any changes to them.

**Search in admin dashboard:** As an administrator, I want to be able to search for property listings, so that I can quickly find the specific property Iâ€™m looking for.

**Create property listing:** As an administrator, I want to be able to create new property listings, so that they can be added to the website.

**Upload property images:** As an administrator, I want to be able to upload images of properties, so that customers can visually assess whether they are interested in a property.

**Update property details:** As an administrator, I want to be able to update the details of property listings, so that I can ensure all information remains accurate and up to date.

**Delete property listing:** As an administrator, I want to be able to delete property listings, so that outdated or irrelevant listings no longer appear to customers.

## System Implementation

### Tech Stack

- `Frontend (Web)`: Blazor
- `Frontend (Desktop)`: JavaFX
- `Backend (REST API)`: Java Spring Boot
- `Real-time notifications`: SignalR
- `Database`: PostgreSQL

## Project Features

### User authentication

**Blazor web application for customers:**

**JavaFX desktop application for administrators:**

**Role-based authentication**\
The system uses role-based authentication to manage access and permissions.

There are two distinct user roles: `USER` and `ADMIN`.

- Customers who register for an account through the Blazor web application are automatically assigned the `USER` role.
- Administrators who register through the JavaFX desktop application are automatically assigned the `ADMIN` role.

Administrators have additional privileges, such as managing property listings. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between administrators and customers. This ensures that customers cannot access API endpoints they are not authorized to use.

**API endpoint security**\
Access control is enforced by our Java REST API, which uses Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization.
Endpoint security is achieved by using `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` on endpoints that only administrators are allowed to access.

### Update user information

### Manage property listings

### Manage agents

### Bookmark property listings

### Book an agent

### Real-time notifications
